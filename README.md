# LFP-simulation-in-turtle-brain
Code to simulate the local field potential in turtle's visual cortex.
This project was my bachelor thesis project, however, I have never backed them up until now since I did not use GitHub at that time.
I was using an electrophysioligical toolkit [LFPy](https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy). Some memory are blurred to me because first it is over 2 years, second, to be honest, I knew little about neuroscience at that time, especially for the local field potential. But that experience was precious to me since it was the first time I tasted the good science. From that time on, I am getting the sense of what a good research should be like. Gilles Laurent as my advisor impressed me a lot for his sharpness in science and his insistence in quantification.
